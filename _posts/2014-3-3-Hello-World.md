Stack Overflow is one of the most renowned question and answer websites for programmers, and is giving a clue on how the world of coding is changing from its survey results issued every year. I collected and analyzed the survey data from 2019 to 2022, and  found out some slight but significant changes over time.
Overall demographic and professional characteristics of programmers
At first, survey participants are not giving answers to all questions, and some questions have unidentified answers like ‘Something else’ that it seemed more reasonable not to make a conclusion in many cases.
Lines with no answer (colored in white) in database columns
The portions of survey participants in Europe, Asia and Africa are slightly increasing while that of America is decreasing.
In gender there is no significant change with man about 90% and woman about 5%.
In the question of whether coding is a main profession, the answer of yes stays at 75%. The portion of amateur programmers (Learning to Code and Coding as Hobby) is also at the same 15% to 16% level.

For age, education level, employment status, the size of organizations where participants are working, there are huge uncertainty from changing high portion of no answers (marked as UNID - unidentified), that I made no conclusion.
- Programing languages preferred over time
In database languages, the portions of 'redis', 'postgresql' and 'mongodb' are increasing, while 'mysql' and 'microsoft sql server' are decreasing. 
In programing languages, Language: the portions of 'typescript', 'python' and 'bash/shell/powershell'  are increasing, while 'sql', 'ocaml', 'C++' and 'C#' are  decreasing.  In future preference,
Programing language preference by global region and generation
In yearly trends above, there are slight changes in trends and drastic moves are hardly found, that I proceeded further deep-dive on the language-related results using 2 dimension charts on year 2019 and 2022.
Here axis y shows portions of language and  axis x gives information on the size of each region or age group. The size of each rectangle signifies how much share is gained in how much important region or age group, and the sum of areas of the same color shows how languages are performing in each group of region or age.
About future preference on database languages, 
’postgresqu' is gaining preference more in America and Europe.   
The popularity of 'redis' and 'sqlite' are more evenly distributed in 3 main regions.     
'mysql' is losing its share in all regions.
In terms of age,    
3%p increase of 'postgresqu' is mainly driven by age 25 to 44.    
The future of 'redis' seems to be even better with drastic increase in Age under 18,     
'sqlite' preference is moving to older generation.    
'mongodb' stays at 11% preference, but younger generation's support on this language is also notable.  
About future preference on programing languages, 
'typerscript' is gaining popularity in all regions.    
‘javascript' and 'html/css' are losing shares in most regions. 

In terms of age,    
'typerscript' shows 2%p increase mainly driven by age under 25.   
'javascript' and 'html/css' are losing shares in all ages.  
'sql' is becoming the language of older people with its share staying at 8%.
