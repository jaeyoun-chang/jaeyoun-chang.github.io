Stack Overflow is one of the most renowned question and answer websites for programmers, and is giving a clue on how the world of coding is changing from its survey results issued every year.  
I have analyzed the survey data from 2019 to 2022, and found out some interesting changes over time as below. 

**Overall demographic and professional characteristics of programmers**  

The portions of survey participants in Europe, Asia and Africa are slightly increasing while that of America is decreasing.

In gender there is no significant change with the portion of man at about 90% and woman at about 5%.

In the question of whether coding is a main profession, the answer of yes stays at 75%. The portion of amateur programmers (Learning to Code and Coding as Hobby) is also at stable 15% to 16% level.

In fact, survey participants are not giving answers to all questions, and some questions have no answer (marked as UNID - unidentified - in charts above) or answers with unclear meanings like ‘Something else’ that it seemed more reasonable not to make a conclusion in many cases.  
For age, education level, employment status, the size of organizations where participants are working, there are huge uncertainty with fluctuating high portions of no or unclear answers, that I did not make any conclusion.

**Programing languages preferred over time**  

In database languages, the portions of 'redis', 'postgresql' and 'mongodb' are increasing, while 'mysql' and 'microsoft sql server' are decreasing.

In programing languages, Language: the portions of 'typescript', 'python' and 'bash/shell/powershell'  are increasing, while 'sql', 'ocaml', 'C++' and 'C#' are  decreasing.

**Programing language preference by global region and generation**  

In yearly trends above, there are some slight moves and drastic changes are hardly found, that I proceeded further deep-dive on the language-related results using 2 dimension charts on year 2019 and 2022.  

Here axis y shows portions of languages and axis x gives information on the size of each region or age group. The size of each rectangle signifies how much share is gained in how much important region or age group, and the sum of areas of the same color shows how languages are performing in each group of region or age.

About future preference on database languages, 
* ’postgresqu' is gaining preference more in America and Europe.  
* The popularity of 'redis' and 'sqlite' are more evenly distributed in 3 main regions.  
* 'mysql' is losing its share in all regions.

In terms of age,  
* 3%p increase of 'postgresqu' is mainly driven by age 25 to 44.    
* The future of 'redis' seems to be even better with drastic increase in Age under 18
* 'sqlite' preference is moving to older generation.    
* 'mongodb' stays at 11% preference, but younger generation's support on this language is also notable.

About future preference on programing languages, 
* 'typerscript' is gaining popularity in all regions.    
* ‘javascript' and 'html/css' are losing shares in most regions.

So, let's return to the initial questions.

**Where on the globe is the number of coding people increasing?**  
It is not America. More people from Europe, Asia and Africa are coming  
into the world of coding.  

**What programing languages are gaining more popularity?**   
'redis', 'postgresql' and 'mongodb' as database languages, and 'typescript',   
'python' and 'bash/shell/powershell' as programing languages are becoming  
more welcomed. 

**What programing languages will have better future?**   
'redis' and 'mongodb' are leading database solutions for younger people,  
and people under 25 are giving more popularity to 'typerscript' in programing.
